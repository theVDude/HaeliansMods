## How to install

1. Download this mod either from clicking Code in the upper righthand corner and selecting Download Zip

2. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLf_vqIYqyo) to learn how to install mods on Hades. You will need ModUtil and ModImporter, which should be covered in that guide and its linked resources. If you're still having trouble, ask in the [Hades Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/KuMbyrN).

3. As a sanity check, once you're done your Mods folder should contain 2 folders, HaeliansMods and ModUtil.
